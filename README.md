In this project, I built a classification model using Random Forest to address imbalanced datasets. I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset, ensuring better model performance. The project involved extensive data preprocessing using pandas and numpy, followed by model training and evaluation using sklearn. I also visualized the results and key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix to assess the effectiveness of the model.
